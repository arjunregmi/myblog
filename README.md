## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

-   [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
-   [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
-   Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
-   Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
-   Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
-   [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
-   [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

You may also try the [Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com), where you will be guided through building a modern Laravel application from scratch.

If you don't feel like reading, [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) can help. Laracasts contains thousands of video tutorials on a range of topics including Laravel, modern PHP, unit testing, and JavaScript. Boost your skills by digging into our comprehensive video library.

## Approach and Challenges i faced while doing this project

# MyBlog Project

## Report

### Approach

1. **Project Setup**:

    - I started by setting up a new Laravel 11 project, following the lecture videos as a guide.
    - Initially, I attempted to install Laravel 11 but faced compatibility issues even though my PHP version was higher than 8.2. I conducted extensive research online and found solutions on Stack Overflow to resolve these installation issues.

2. **Database Setup**:

    - During the setup process, I followed the lecture instructions to configure a MongoDB environment for my project.
    - Later, I realized that MongoDB was not required for Assignment 1, so I switched to a MySQL environment. This switch caused my project to crash. Fortunately, I had pushed my code to GitHub, allowing me to restore it and continue working without significant delays.

3. **Core Functionality**:
    - I implemented the core functionalities of creating and displaying posts as shown in the lecture videos.
    - Beyond what was covered in the lectures, I added features for editing and deleting posts to enhance the application's usability.

### Challenges Faced

1. **Laravel 11 Installation Issues**:

    - Despite having a compatible PHP version, I encountered problems installing Laravel 11. This required considerable research and troubleshooting, relying heavily on community forums and resources.

2. **Database Environment Changes**:

    - Switching from MongoDB to MySQL led to a project crash. Recovering from this crash was only possible because I had the foresight to push my code to GitHub, demonstrating the importance of version control.

3. **Discrepancies Between Lecture and Practical Application**:
    - The code provided in the lecture worked seamlessly on the instructor's machine but not on mine. This discrepancy necessitated additional research and problem-solving to ensure the code functioned correctly on my setup.

### Extra Features

In addition to the core functionalities, I implemented the following extra features:

1. **Pagination**:

    - I added pagination to the posts display page, ensuring a better user experience by not overwhelming the user with too much information at once.

2. **Enhanced Post Display**:
    - The method for displaying posts was improved to include a summary view with a "Read More" link, making the interface more user-friendly and intuitive.

### Bonus Point Justification

I believe I deserve the extra bonus point for the following reasons:

1. **Pagination Feature**:

    - Implementing pagination significantly enhances the usability of the application, making it more professional and scalable for handling a larger number of posts.

2. **Problem-Solving and Resilience**:

    - The challenges I faced and overcame, such as the Laravel 11 installation issues and the database environment switch, demonstrate my determination and problem-solving skills.

3. **Extra Functionality Beyond Requirements**:
    - Adding edit and delete functionalities, along with pagination, showcases my initiative to go beyond the basic requirements and provide a more comprehensive solution.

Thank you for considering my work for the extra bonus point. I am proud of the additional features and the resilience demonstrated throughout the project.
